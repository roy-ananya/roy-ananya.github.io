            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I work as a Senior Data Scientist at a financial institution where I currently lead various machine learning projects in NLP â€“ like building document classifiers, named entity recognition - to automate routine tasks and assisting in making better strategic decisions. I have over 7 years of experience in building machine learning products from scratch, both frequentist/traditional machine learning and bayesian probabilistic models, and automated and deployed models at scale in production. My previous experience across various sectors like auto, sports has given me the opportunity to work on a diverse set of problems - I built and led the development of critical ML component at an Indian startup, worked on land pricing models for the Goverment of India, worked on cutting edge predictive models in sports modelling. I have experience working with Amazon Web Services and dabble with GCP and am proficient in Python, R, Stan, Tensorflow, etc. </p>
            
            <p>I love solving problems and decided to pursue an undergraduate degree in Pure Mathematics from University of Delhi, Sri Venkateswara College and fell in love with it. Thereafter, I did my masters in Pure Math and gained some research experience at the Indian Statistical Institute(ISI), Kolkata, India. During this time, I gravitated towards Applied Math and decided to go for another Masters in Applied/Financial Math from the London School of Economics(LSE), UK where I took some courses in financial math. I particularly enjoyed Stochastic Calculus and solving SDE's! I also gained an interest in Machine Learning/ Deep Learning at the time and on doing some initial reading, I really enjoyed the theoretical math behind the ML algorithms and applying it to actual problems. What captivated my attention was the ability to see your model being
